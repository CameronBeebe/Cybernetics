A toy implementation of the game theoretic foundation of cybernetic systems theory as outlined by W. R. Ashby.

Connectionist artificial neural networks are cybernetic regulators.

TO DO:

1.  Ability to input game, not just game_size (so can compare multiple runs on same game).  DONE, NEEDS LOGIC CHECK / TEST in train.py AND DOCSTRING UPDATED

2.  Game analysis: check goals against random game composition (i.e. calculate availability of success to compare to regulator performance)

3.  Clean up verbosity for notebook (inline accuracy meter?)

4.  Create options for different forms of reinforcement.

5.  Add normalization function to urn (value in regulator dictionary)?

6.
